# Getting Started with Drafti

I created this repo as a quick way for me to get up and running with a WYSIWYG editor for my ReactJS apps. I have been building this for my needs and the tools and features that I use the most. There are not many settings for the React component and right now you just import Drafty and add the

``<Drafti />``

tag to your app to pull in the editor. I am adding new features so if you do find this and want to use it that's great.
